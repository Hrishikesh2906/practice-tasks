## ***WELCOME TO MY PERSONAL BLOG***

The reason why I wanted to join **AMRITA CS-STAR** is due to intrest in coding and I want to learn and explore more whats hapenning in the field of Computer Science.

I am intersted in the field of Web content management, Wireless sensor networks and Data analytics.

If i'm selected to the club, i would like to work on Wireless Sensor Networks. The main reason I would like to join this field is because i'm intersted to know how these systems works and how to improve new ones.
